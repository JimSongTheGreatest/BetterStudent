# BetterStudent

Using Java, SQL, and JavaFx

Our program features

  - -	This software will incorporate Java, and JavaFX.
  -	A flexible and easy to use software would fill the gap of the correlation between achieving higher grades/GPA and taking care of oneself.
  -	Track eating, sleeping, and studying to see how the individual is.
  -	Give a survey on their current habits and lifestyle and give personalized advice on how they can do better.
  -	Users' data would be stored permanently until they choose to add, delete, or change their data input for a renewed personalized advice.
  -	Running it shall be easy and won’t need installing anything else.
  -	It shall run on all existing OS’s (windows, mac, linux) with JavaFX.
  -	Future plans would be to modify the software to let users know they could benefit from more sleep, more meals eaten, and more hours studied, depending on their GPA.
